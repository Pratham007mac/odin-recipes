# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum, where I will create a website that showcases a collection of my favorite recipes. The primary goal is to practice and demonstrate my skills in web development, particularly in HTML and CSS.

Throughout this project, I will be focusing on:

- Structuring web pages using HTML5 semantic elements to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- Applying CSS styles to create visually appealing layouts, including responsive design principles to ensure the site looks great on various devices.
- Implementing best practices for code organization and documentation, making my codebase easy to understand and maintain.

## Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- Proficient use of HTML and CSS to build a fully functional website.
- Understanding of responsive web design techniques to create a user-friendly experience across different screen sizes.
- Ability to structure a project effectively, including folder organization and file naming conventions.
- Experience in documenting a project using a README file, which is essential for collaboration and sharing with others.

This project will serve as a valuable addition to my portfolio and a stepping stone in my journey as a web developer. I look forward to the challenges and learning experiences it will bring!
